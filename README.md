## ‚ú® Description
This is a script to place a gun rack in the world, and use it for storing weapons.

## üëÄ Usage
Use the included sql script to create the required table and add the snippet below to create the item. Use the `gunrack` item in your inventory to start the placement process. Once you've placed the rack, you can then target the rack to store weapons in it, or take weapons from it.

## üìö Items
You will need to add a `gunrack` item to your inventory items list.

```
['gunrack'] = {
  label = 'Gun Rack',
  weight = 10000,
  stack = false,
  consume = 0,
  client = {
      export = 'js5m_gunrack.placeGunRack',
  },
},
```

## ‚úÖ TODO
- PRs are always welcome to add more weapons to the config. I'm sure I'm missing some.
- Make stun gun its own space
- Add ammo/armor storage spaces
- Optimize offsets and rotations
- Add `prop_cs_gunrack` functionality
