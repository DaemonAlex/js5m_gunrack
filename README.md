## ‚ú® Description
This is a script to place a gun rack in the world, and use it for storing weapons.

## üëÄ Usage
Use the `gunrack` item in your inventory to start the placement process. Once you've placed the rack, you can then target the rack to store weapons in it, or take weapons from it.

## üìö Items
You will need to add a `gunrack` item to your inventory items list.

```
['gunrack'] = {
  label = 'Gun Rack',
  weight = 10000,
  stack = false,
  consume = 0,
  client = {
      export = 'js5m_gunrack.placeGunRack',
  },
},
```

## üîó Dependencies
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
- qb-target - This was used because ox_target has backwards compatibility for qb-target, so it will work with that aswell.
- [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
- [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)
